# How to Play

This game follows the standard rules of Minesweeper. These rules can be found elsewhere, but to summarize: 

Some cells have mines under them. You win when you open (by clicking) all cells that do not contain a mine. If you unearth a mine, you lose. 
Deduce the location of mines using the number on empty cells. The number represents the total number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells.

Start the game by clicking any square. Dont worry! You can't lose on the first click ;)

## Controls

Left click to open a cell
Right click to place (or unplace) a flag. This marks a spot where you think a mine might be. A flagged cell cannot be opened, unless you unflag it first. 

Clicking the Submit button will apply any settings, and restart the game.
